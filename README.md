* As a player I want to know if my answer is true or false. So I can correct the answer.
* As a player I want to see the result of game. So I can know if I lose or win.

## Planning/Development process and problem-solving strategy :
* Create New Repository in GitHub Enterprise.
* Prepare the Folders and Files for the game.
  * create README.md.
  * create index.html.
  * create js folder.
    * create main.js.
  * create css folder.
    * create style.css.
  * create image folder.
    * wireframes image.
* Start desiging the layout of the game in index.html.
* Add temporary style to the layout in styles.css.
* Work on main.js to build the logic of the game
  * Create an object contains a three arrays for three levels (easy , medium , hard).
  * build the board of the game.
  * start timer.
  * Add click event for each empty box in board and number.
  * write the number Inside the box , check if it correct or no.
  * Increase the mistak if the answer is wrong.
  * Add color effects to the correct and wrong answer.
  * check the result of game if lose or win and print the result.
* Change the temporary style in style.css.

## favorite functions :
* My favorite function is that build the 81 boxs and check the array to decide Which boxes have a number or empty ,
 then add the event for each empty boxes.
* Also the function that check if the answer is correct or not , and add effect (change the color).

## possible enhancements for future versions :
* Make the game responsive.
* Add a specific timer for each levels.
* Increase the number of arrays.

## Unsolved Problems :
Nothing.

## Problem Soving strategy :
* Divide the code into small pieces.
* Add console.log in each pieces.
* Read the error in console.
* Search about the error and try to solve it.
